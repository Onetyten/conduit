Key Features for Your Conduit Demo

To create a compelling demo for Conduit that will impress recruiters, focus on showcasing the core functionality that highlights the value proposition for both users and service providers. Here are the essential features to implement:

For the User (Customer) Side

    User Registration and Profile: Allow users to sign up, log in, and create a basic profile. This is fundamental for any platform.

    Service Search and Discovery: Implement a way for users to search for services (e.g., by category, keyword, or location). Display a list of service providers with basic information like name, service offered, and a brief description.

    Service Provider Profile Viewing: When a user clicks on a service provider from the search results, they should be able to view a more detailed profile. This should include:

        Service listings with descriptions and (optional) pricing.

        Contact information (e.g., a "Message" button).

        (Optional but Recommended) A way to display the service provider's availability or a "Book Appointment" button.

    Messaging System (Basic): A simple in-app messaging feature allowing users to send a message to a service provider. You don't need a full-blown chat application, but demonstrating that communication is possible is key.

    Appointment Booking (Simulated or Basic):

        Simulated: A button that says "Request Appointment" or "Book Now" which, when clicked, shows a confirmation message (e.g., "Your appointment request has been sent!").

        Basic: A simple form where users can select a date and time from a predefined set of available slots or input their preferred time. This could then generate a placeholder "pending" appointment.

For the Service Provider Side

    Service Provider Registration and Profile Creation: Allow service providers to sign up and create their profiles. They should be able to add:

        Their business name and contact information.

        A description of their services.

        Categories of services they offer.

        (Optional but Recommended) Their general availability or operating hours.

    Service Listing Management: Service providers should be able to add, edit, and delete the specific services they offer. This includes service name, description, and (optional) pricing.

    Viewing Messages/Appointment Requests: A simple inbox or dashboard where service providers can see messages from users and incoming appointment requests. For the demo, simply displaying the messages/requests is sufficient, no need for complex response mechanisms.

What to Prioritize for a Demo

When building your demo, focus on usability and visual clarity. Recruiters want to see that you can build functional software with a good user experience.

    Intuitive Navigation: Make it easy for users to find what they're looking for.

    Clean UI/UX: A well-designed interface, even if simple, makes a big difference. Use consistent styling.

    Responsive Design (if web-based): Ensure your demo looks good on different screen sizes.

    Dummy Data: Populate your demo with realistic-looking dummy data for services and providers so the platform doesn't appear empty.

By implementing these core features, you'll have a strong, functional demo that effectively showcases your abilities in building a local service aggregator. Good luck!
